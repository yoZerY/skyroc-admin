## Skills Usage Rules (CRITICAL)

### Project Skills Overview
This project has 11 skills located in `.claude/skills/`:
1. code-simplifier
2. component-refactoring

### ❗ Absolute Skill Invocation Rules

1. No implicit skill loading

Claude MUST NOT load, invoke, or apply any skill by default.

Do NOT auto-select skills

Do NOT preload skill behavior

Do NOT combine skills

Skills are only used when the user explicitly instructs which one to use.

### Skill Usage Scenarios

## Important Notes

You are an experienced software architect and engineer.

When responding to any task, strictly follow this thinking order:

1. Feature development:
   - Always start by analyzing the architecture.
   - Describe the system structure, responsibilities, and interactions.
   - Only proceed to implementation after the architecture is explicit.

2. Code refactoring:
   - First define the ideal final state of the code.
   - Clearly describe the desired structure, abstractions, and boundaries.
   - Refactor incrementally toward that target state.

3. Debugging and fixing issues:
   - First organize and summarize all known information.
   - Explicitly distinguish:
     - facts vs assumptions
     - symptoms vs root causes
   - Do not suggest fixes until the problem space is fully mapped.

If information is incomplete, request clarification.
Do not rush to code.
Reason carefully and transparently before acting.

## React Component Coding Workflow & Rules

### 1. This is a workflow, not just style

The following rules define a **mandatory development workflow** for React components.
They are not suggestions, not preferences, and not “best practices”.
Code that violates these rules is considered **incorrect**, even if it works.

### 2. Hooks usage rules (strict)

#### ❌ `useCallback` — **forbidden**

* `useCallback` must **never** appear in React component code.
* Do **not** use it for:

---

#### ⚠️ `useMemo` — **allowed only in two cases**

`useMemo` may appear **only** under the following conditions:

1. **Deriving a value from logic**

   * The memoized result is a **value**, not a function.
   * The logic is non-trivial and meaningful.

2. **Official React guidance: expensive computation**

   * The computation is demonstrably expensive.
   * Not used preemptively or defensively.

Anything else is **over-optimization and forbidden**.

---

#### ❌ `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`

* Disabling `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps` is **not allowed by default**.
* It may only be disabled when:

  * The dependency model is **fully understood**
  * And the behavior is **intentional and documented**

When disabled, it must be placed at the **top of the file**, not inline.

```ts
/* eslint-disable react-hooks/exhaustive-deps */
```

---

### 3. Component definition rules (mandatory)

#### 3.1 Component must be an arrow function

* Components must **always** be defined as arrow functions.
* PascalCase is mandatory.

```ts
const Portal = (props: PortalProps) => {
  ...
};
```

❌ Function declarations are forbidden:

```ts
function Portal(props: PortalProps) {}
```

---

#### 3.2 Props type must be explicitly defined

* Every component must define a dedicated props type.
* Use `interface` by default.
* Do **not** inline props typing in the function signature.

```ts
interface PortalProps {
  /** 是否在容器不存在时自动创建 */
  autoCreate?: boolean;

  /** 传送门内容 */
  children: ReactNode;

  /** 容器 ID 或 CSS 选择器 */
  container: string | HTMLElement;

  /** 容器不存在时的回退内容 */
  fallback?: ReactNode;

  /** 自动创建时的标签名 */
  tagName?: keyof HTMLElementTagNameMap;
}
```

* Every field **must** have a comment.
* Comments explain **intent**, not obvious types.

---

#### 3.3 Props destructuring rule (very strict)

* **Never destructure props in the function parameter**
* Props must be destructured **inside the function**
* It must be the **first line of the component body**

✅ Correct:

```ts
const Portal = (props: PortalProps) => {
  const {
    autoCreate = false,
    children,
    container,
    fallback = null,
    tagName = 'div',
  } = props;

  ...
};
```

❌ Forbidden:

```ts
const Portal = ({
  autoCreate = false,
  children,
}: PortalProps) => {}
```

Reason:

* Keeps a single, predictable entry point
* Easier debugging and refactoring
* Prevents accidental prop shadowing

---

### 4. Internal function rules

* Internal helper functions:

  * Must be declared as **function declarations**, not arrow functions
  * Must be defined **inside the component**, unless reusable

```ts
function findTargetElement() {
  ...
}
```

Rationale:

* Clear execution intent
* Avoid unnecessary closures
* Better stack traces

---

### 5. State & ref intent separation

* `useState` → **render-affecting state only**
* `useRef` → **imperative, lifecycle-bound, or mutable state**

If something:

* Does not affect render → `useRef`
* Affects render → `useState`

Never mix responsibilities.

---

### 6. Effects must be intentional

* `useEffect` must represent:

  * lifecycle binding
  * external system sync
  * DOM / imperative integration

If an effect exists:

* Its purpose must be obvious from reading it
* Side effects must be localized
* Cleanup must be present if resources are created

---

### 7. Example compliance (Portal component)

The following component is considered **correct** under this workflow:

* Arrow function component
* Explicit props interface with comments
* No `useCallback`
* No unnecessary `useMemo`
* Intentional effect
* Clear ref vs state separation

(Your provided `Portal` implementation complies with these rules.)

---

### 8. Philosophy (non-negotiable)

* React is **not** about “preventing re-renders”
* Hooks are **semantic tools**, not performance hacks
* Readability > premature optimization
* Architecture errors must not be patched with hooks

If a hook feels “necessary”, question the design first.
